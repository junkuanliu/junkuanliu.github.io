    "content": "Since GPT-3, teaching AI to operate computers and phones has been a persistent ambition. Many systems have been proposedâ€”some tool-centric, some rule-driven, some end-to-end. This post looks at why reinforcement learning, vision-language models, and engineered environments are converging toward dependable GUI agents, covering dataset design, verifiable rewards, and the data bottlenecks that still remain."
